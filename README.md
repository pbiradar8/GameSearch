# GameSearch
This is an iOS Mobile Application for searching the games online as a part of iOS Exercise by Quicken Loans

### The Description given is ###

Create an app that searches a video game database with a search string that the user inputs. For example, you may choose to use the Giant Bomb API (register for an API key at http://www.giantbomb.com/api/), where an example HTTP request for game search would be:
http://www.giantbomb.com/api/search/?api_key=[API_KEY]&format=json&query="[SEARCH_TERM]"&resources=game

The app should take input from the user, query the database, and display any results or errors to the user. At a minimum, display a thumbnail image (if available) and the name of each result. The flow and design of the app is important and should provide an intuitive user experience. Performance is also important, especially when displaying the images of the results.
